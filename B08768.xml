            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REASONS OF A FAST, Appoynted by the Commiſsion <hi>of the Generall Aſſemblie:</hi> To bee kept through all the Kirks of this <hi>Kingdom, on the LORDS DAY;</hi> December 22. 1650.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Commiſsion of the Generall Aſſemblie, ſeriouſly conſidering, That how-ſo-ever this Land lyeth under the Guiltineſs of many-fold Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of al ſorts, againſt the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the Law of GOD, abounding, in all Rancks &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of People: Yet, that the deſpyſing and refuſing of the Goſpell, and of the Rich Free Grace of GOD in CHRIST held foorth therein, is the Great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Sinne of this Kirk and Kingdom, againſt which the LORD is moſt evidently and remarkeably, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Contraverſie in His preſent judgements vpon the Land: And, that this is the very Fountayn and Cauſe of ſo great abounding of all other ſinnes. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:180510:2"/>
alſo, that this Sinne having been often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and held foorth amongſt the Cauſes of former Faſts, hath been little, or no wayes at all, layd to heart. Yea, nor well underſtood what it meaneth by the moſt part of People. And, therefore, having appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Faſt and Humiliation to bee kept eſpecially for this Sinne, on the LORDS Day, December xxij. 1650, throughout all the Congregations of this Kirk, it is thought fit, to the effect, That all may haue the more clear and diſtinct apprehenſion of the foreſayd Sinne, and bee helped the better, to diſcern their guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs therein; To hold foorth unto People, the Mayn Branches thereof, in this Paper which is deſyred to bee read in all Congregations.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Sinnes relating to the Gospell-Ordinances.</head>
               <p>FIrſt: To the WORD. Neglecting to come and attend on the Preaching of the Word, both on the LORDS Day, and on week dayes, in theſe places where ſuch Exerciſes, are on theſe dayes.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Not comming to the Preaching of the Word, for the right end, viz to fynd communion with Chriſt, and a taſte of His goodnes and excellencie, &amp; to be built vp in the moſt holy fayth: but eyther out of cuſtome or to eſchew cenſures, or to ſatisfy &amp; hold off the challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges of a naturall conſcience; or ſome other by-reſpect. And not preparing the heart befor hand in ſecret, to come with Godly fear and reverence, humility, ſpiritual hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and thirſting after the Kingdom of God, and the Righteouſnes thereof, and deſyring as new born babes the ſincere milk of the Word, to grow thereby,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:180510:2"/>3 That when People are at the preaching of the word, beſyds great careleſnes, overlines ſleeping, wandring of the heart, &amp; in advertencie to what is preached; the Word is not heard as an Ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and meane appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God to work vpon, and carry in grace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vnto the heart, but is only reguarded as other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes proceeding from mens ability and parts, and is accordingly eſteemed by the moſt part, or at moſt is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made vſe of, as a mean of informing the judgement.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That in the preaching of the Word, neyther doeth Miniſters ſpeak the ſame as the Oracles of God, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring themſelves to be the ambaſſadours of Chriſt, ſpeaking in Gods ſtead: nor doeth people preſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſo immediat a way befor God Himſelf as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Word not as the Word of man, but as the true Word of God; whence it commeth to paſs that there is litle trembling at the Word, and ſo litle rejoycing in it.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That people in the hearing of the Word, contents themſelves with mans teaching, and doeth not in the conviction of their own blindnes &amp; vtter inability of themſelves to perceive the things of the Spirit, and of the inſufficiencie of the outward means without Gods immediat work therewith vpon the heart; imploy Him ſelf to teach them inwardly by His Spirit, joyning with the outward means, according to the promiſe of the Covenant. They ſhal be al taught of God: whence it commeth to paſs that there is ſo much Preaching, and ſo little profiting, ſo much Learning, and ſo little ſpeed comming in the knowledge of GOD.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The not mixing of the Word preached with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180510:3"/>
Fayth, whyle as in the hearing thereof; even theſe who ſeem to giue moſt heed thereunto do for the moſt part, rather imploy the judgement, to conſider and judge of the pertinencie, coherence, the way of utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the doctrine delivered; or in a meer ſpeculatiue way to apprehend the matter &amp; trueth of what is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken than they do labour, with the heart to cloſe with, embrace and apply to themſelues the Trueth preached.</p>
               <p n="7">7 No care to lay up, &amp; hyde the words of CHRIST in the heart, to remember the ſame for uſe making: But letting them ſlip and run thorow; which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle accounteth a neglecting of the Great Salvation of GOD, (HEB. 2.1.3.) Nor imploying the Spirit to bring the Word that hath been heard; but forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to remembrance: Not making conſcience to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre on the Word Preached, and to whet it on, upon an other. Not taking payns, nor delight in it, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, to reade, and meditate on it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IN relation to the Sacraments. And firſt in general &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon: Not making vſe of them as Seals of the Covenant of Grace, and promiſes thereof made to us in Chriſt; but laying al the weyght of confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelves &amp; being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with the deed done, which was the ordinary ſin of the Iews in the vſe of Circumciſion, &amp; other Rits and ceremonies of the Law, ſo often char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon them in Scripture. Then particularly.</p>
               <p>In Baptiſme. 1 In Parents bringing their Children therevnto, eyther out of meer faſhion and cuſtome, as meerly to have a difference put between them, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtned people, or in effect as vnto a meer ceremonie:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:180510:3"/>
and not from any ſenſe that they are vnclean from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, born dead in ſins, and children of wrath of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, defyled with original guilt and corruption, nor from a deſyre that they may be ſpiritually regenerated, incorporated vnto Chriſt, to be made partakers of the vertue of His Death &amp; Reſurrection, to be waſhed from their filthines in the blood of Chriſt, and to get intereſt in the Covenant of grace, and promiſes thereof, ſealed vp vnto them. 2 Not ſetting themſelves in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this Sacrament to conſider &amp; pryze the free love and grace of God, which hath prevented vs, &amp; our ſeed in provyding ſuch a fountain for ſin &amp; vnclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in Chriſt, making ſuch a Covenant with vs, ſo well ordered in al things, &amp; ſure preventing vs and our ſeed with the ſeall thereof; nor to apply the Covenant and the promiſes thereof for our ſelves and our ſeed, and this Sacrament as the ſeall of the ſame. 3. The great &amp; evident ſlighting of the adminiſtration of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while as few in the Congregation joyneth therin eyther for their own edification, or to hold vp the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized to God, that He might bleſs His own ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to them, and receive them in amongſt His Children in Chriſt: and many with-draweth themſelves from the adminiſtration thereof, as if it did not concern them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and only the Miniſter and Preſenter were to be actors in it. 4 Parents not making conſcience, to make known vnto their Children when they come to years of Capacity their Baptiſm, the ends and vſe thereof, and the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therby layeth vpon them as conſecrated to Chriſt. 5 The not making vſe of this Sacrament all a-long the courſe of our, lyf for renewing &amp; ſtrengthening our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180510:4"/>
in the Fayth and aſſurance of our Regeneration &amp; Adoption; and of our intereſt in God, as our GOD and Father in CHRIST: and for ſtrenthening through Chriſt our reſolutions &amp; endeavours of Mortification, and newneſs of lyf. Which is a great deſpyſing of this Ordinance.</p>
               <p>In the Lords Supper, 1. The great profanation ther of, by the comming and admitting there vnto: of many groſs Ignorants, who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not diſcern the Lords Body, nor knoweth how to examine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y profane Ones, Godleſs Livers, without the Worſhip of GOD, in private, and into many places al ſorts of perſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly without making a difference between the precious &amp; the Vyle: whereby the Blood of Chriſt, is much profaned (altho the conſtitutions of our Kirk were they well obſerved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth ſufficiently guard againſt theſe evills) Which no doubt is one of the mayn ſins, for which GOD hath beene provoked to ſuffer ſo much of our blood to be ſhed. See 1, Cor. 11.30.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The little or no care or payns that is taken for preparation to ſo high and holy an Ordinance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are called to the neareſt and moſt familiar Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, that is: heere vpon earth: moſt part contenting themſelves giving their preſence at a Preparation Sermon, many not making conſcience of ſo much as this. Very few ſeparating themſelves, as is needfull to examine themſelves; that being ſenſible of their Guiltyneſs, Spirituall inlacks &amp;c. They might come with humble, broken, and contrite Spirits, with Spirituall hunger and thirſt, for Chriſt Crucified. And ſincere purpoſes of heart, to forſake their former ſinfull
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:180510:4"/>
courſes, and to renew their Covenant with GOD, in the ſtrength of CHRISTS Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The great and lamentable Blockiſhneſs of the moſt part, in the participation of this Ordinance, who may be, have ſome kynd of amazement at the Solemnityes thereof, but doth no wyſe therein exercyſe themſelves in remembring the Lords Death, till He come agayn to apply the ſame to themſelves: for peace with GOD, and mortifying the Body of Sin, for working deep Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Goſpell ſorrow for Sin, and getting the Love of Chriſt, more kindled in them, and their hearts enlarged with greater thankfulneſs towards Him, Who loved vs, and gave Himſelf for vs. And on the other hand the great heartleſs ſinfull Dejection of many ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Souls, who at no tyme are readyer to be plunged in legall heavyneſs; &amp; feeding as it were on gall, and Worm-wood: then at this Ordinance, wherein they ought to be moſt rejoycing through Fayth, on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation in the Death of Chriſt, ſo familiarly ſet foorth therein to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That the tyme and occaſion of this Sacrament, is vſed by the moſt part, only for ſome outward reſtraint of groſſer ſins, for a day or two before and after; but all ſuch goodnes being as a morning clowd, no conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie nor reall reformation: but preſently turning to wonted, naturall, worldly, and carnall courſes; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with-ſtanding renewed remembring of the Death of CHRIST, and Profeſsion of renewing Covnants with GOD.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:180510:5"/>3. IN Relation, To the Ordinance of Diſcipline: 1. Which partiality in the adminiſtration of there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with reſpect of perſons, and according to affection; which appeareth in that, whyle as Offences and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalles, in meaner perſons, are taken notice of, challen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged and cenſured: There is not the lyke Chriſtian-Freedom, Faythfulneſs and Zeall uſed, towards ſuch as are more eminent for Wealth, Place, or Dignitie, in the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Want of a Spirit of Meekneſs, ſometymes in the adminiſtration thereof; whereby men, if GOD per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure would give them Repentance, might bee recovered out of the Snare of Satan. And, on the other hand, want of Zeall often tymes, to ſaue others with fear, plucking them out of the Fyre.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Much Vilifying, Contemning of the Cenſures &amp; Exerciſe of Diſcipline: Yea, hateing thereof, and the Officers of the Kirk for it.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Not making uſe of it, as a Spirituall Medicine, and Means of Salvation: but as a meer Puniſhment, which as it is in it ſelff a miſs-apprehenſion and abuſe of this Ordinance: So is (no doubt,) the cauſe of ſo much impatience and indignation agaynſt it in people; and of ſo much inaequality, and mixture of ſelfiſh affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in the adminiſtration thereof.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The great Formality, that is every where, in the vſe thereof, whyle as, ſo bee it, that perſons under cenſure continue out their ſet tyme and dayes of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, little care or reſpect is had of the effects for which it was inſtituted: To wit, Humiliation of hearr, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:180510:5"/>
Godly ſorrow, bringing foorth Repentance, not to bee repented of; which maketh the adminiſtration thereof, to look too lyke the way of Popiſh Pennance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. IN Relation to Prayer: 1. Great neglect thereof by moſt part of perſons and families throughout the Land in private and ſecret.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Many more imminent perſons in the World, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting the performance thereof in their families, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho this bee incumbent to them, by their Place and Station,) a diſparidgement; and therefore turning it over vpon others, as a Service bee low them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In the publick Prayers of the Kirk, Peoples lying by, from joyning therein, al along with their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which ſhould bee ſtryving together with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; either mutering words of their own; or taking liberty to themſelues, to bee ydle in the work, and raving in their thoughts: As if the Miniſter only were to bee an Actor in that Service.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Not uſing this Ordinance, as a mean of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with GOD, and of obtayning bleſſings from Him: But uſing it meerly as a Duety; and many as a matter of meer task. Whereof many may bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by this; That they do not make conſcience, nor ſetteth themſelues to obſerue what commeth of their Prayers; how they are taken off their hand, what ſpeed they haue come, and what anſwer they get.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The little care that is had either by Miniſters, or others, to pray in the Spirit; or to imploy the Spirit of Grace, and Supplication for this Service: The moſt part
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:180510:6"/>
in their performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces thereof, too evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly acting meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their own memory, invention, wit, &amp;c. And that often tymes with apparent affectation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. RElating more immediatelye to CHRIST Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Free Grace of GOD in Him, which is the Matter and Object of the Goſpell, as:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Groſs ignorance in the moſt part, and great ſhort comeing of the beſt in the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt His Perſon, offices, His blesſings and benefits, of the Covenant of grace; eſtabliſhed in Him and the way of making vſe of Chriſt and the covenant of grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Undervaluing and miſpryſing of Chriſt, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Him, &amp; His ſpiritual graces and blesſings. Which appears moſt evidently, by the great neglect of the vſe of theſe means and exercyſes, publick, privat &amp; ſecret wherein He offereth Himſelf to be ſought &amp; found: the great wearying of them: great willingnes and readines to beſtow tyme and payns vpon things worldly even vanityes &amp; trifls than on theſe; preferring the intereſts of creatures to the intereſts of Chriſt; and not giving Him the preheminence above al: by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines which appears in people in tymes of tryall to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with ſinful courſes; to the prejudice of Chriſts cauſs and the hazarding of their own peace with God, for maintayning their caſe; temporary ſafety and worldly commodities rather then to deny themſelves: take vp their croſs and follow Him.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Not receiving of Chriſt, nor making vſe of Him as He is held foorth in the Goſpell, in His fulnes of grace,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:180510:6"/>
nor living in fayth by Him, more eſpecially in Not re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiving and making vſe of His free gifted and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteouſnes for Iuſtification, acceptation befor God, and for peace of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience. while as moſt part ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely reſt on meer outward church priviledges: many confyde in their own Morall Honeſtly, performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,; and Duetyes. So going about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, and following Duetyes this way to make their Peace, and Reconciliation there by with GOD: AND even the Beſt Profeſſours no not ſo purely &amp; inteirly reſt on his righteouſnes as the Goſpell requyreth: as well appear by theſe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many others: heartleſs fears, miſs-be-lieff, I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to apply Chriſt, and to make vſe of the promiſes, not rejoicing in Chriſt, and His propitiation with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, when there is a diſcovery, challenges and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of want, ſhort comming &amp; failing of duetyes, which in effect is in a degree, and in part an eſtabliſhing our own righteouſneſs and not ſubmitting to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of GOD. Not making vſe of Chriſt, for San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, according to the promiſes of the Covenant, and not acting in a way of dependence on Him, in al the performances of our common Chriſtian calling, and of particular lawful vocations, for direction, quickning, ſtrength to mortify corruptions, to every duety and to carry vs through agaynſt diſcowragements, &amp; tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but acting only or moſt part by the ſtrength of our own wits, abilityes, and payns</p>
               <p>In not making vſe of the Mediation and interceſſion of Chriſt, in approaching to the Throne of Grace, in prayers, ſupplications, and thankſgivings: while as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:180510:7"/>
many doeth neglect prayer altogether albeit they have ſome courſe of performancce of this duety, yet knoweth not what it is to put their prayers vp to GOD thorow the Mediator, tho they may perhaps name His Name, but doth as that Uzziah who would offer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe himſelf, neglecting the high prieſt: and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers themſelves doth not directly, diſtinctly, and ſteadfaſtly in their approaches to God, eye Chriſt, to offer in al their ſervice through Him, nor do come with that humble boldneſs and full aſſurance of fayth in God as a Father, where with the interceſſion of Chriſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randeth them to come, Heb. 10.19.20, 21, 22</p>
               <p n="4">4 Not walking as becometh the Goſpell of Chriſt, in Righteouſnes, godlines, and ſobriety: many not-with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their profeſſion of the goſpell, and claming intereſt in Chriſt, and His grace, yet living looſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, godleſs, carnall, and earthly in their way, in effect turning the grace of God, vnto wantoneſs &amp; ſecurety, and taking liberty to ſin, becauſe grace doth abound. And even beſt not ſo conſtrayned with the love of Chriſt, to live to Him, who dyed for them, not ſtry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to keep the thoughts of the love of Chriſt, and the free grace of God, in Him, vpon their hears, ſo freſh &amp; conſtant, as they ſhould be, to keep the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> watchfull, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der zealous, &amp; enlarged for God, and His Honour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In relation to the operations of the Spirit wherein the Goſpel is the Miniſtration, &amp; maketh it effectuall, as:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Profane mocking, miſcalling, &amp; miſ-interpreting the tender &amp; acurat wolking of the Godly in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:180510:7"/>
wayes of God; as vnneceſſary and prowd precyſeneſs: And their Spirituall exercyſes, as fantaſtickneſs, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, or madneſs. Which is a horrible ſin, ſib to that which is vnpardonable: yet, very frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt carnall and naturall people.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The meer naturall and morall way of living, in a civill honeſty, and ſitting down contented therewith, of the moſt part of people not labouring in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, to walk after the Spirit: i. e. upon Spirituall Principles, according to the Spirituall Rule, (of Gods revealed Will in His Word,) nor for Spiritual ends the Honour of God, Glory, and immortality.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Not obſerving and yeelding vnto the knockings of the Spirit, whereby Chriſt maketh tender to come in to hearts, that He may ſup with them, and they with Him: reſiſting and quenching His motions, whereby He ſtirreth vp to Duetyes ſtiffling or putting by His challenges, whether in publick or ſecret, which tendeth to repentance, humiliation, or with-draw-ing from ſin; not being tender of His preſence and conſolations, to entertayn the ſame; but grieving Him, by miſpryzing them, refuſing them, careleſs walking, in not attending on His direction and guiding, in giving way to known ſinfull thoughts, and luſtings in a continued tract, altho not growing vp to a full accompliſhing of them; and ſometymes in giving way even to groſſer out-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and in not watching agaynſt predominant cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, whereof even the beſt are much guilty.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Not delighting in, nor improving Spiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and ſpirituall exerciſes.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Of Miniſters, in relation to their preaching of the Goſpell, as:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:180510:8"/>1 Many not labouring to ſett foorth the Excellency of Chriſt in His Perſon, Offices, and the vnſearchable Riches of His Grace, the new Covenant, and the way of living by Fayth in Him: nor making this the mayn and chief Theme, and matter of their preaching, as did the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 3.2. 2. Cor. 4.5. Coloſſ. 1.28. Nor preaching other things with a relation to Chriſt; To wit, Not preaching convictions, reprooffs, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of ſin, and of ſhort commings in Duetyes, and threatnings, to leade to Chriſt, to pryze Him the more highly, and to embrace Him the more earneſtlie; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for juſtification; and preſſing Duetyes, in a meer legall way; not urging them, as by the authority of Gods Commandements; ſo from the love of Chriſt, &amp; the grace of the Goſpell, nor poynting and directing people to their furniture for them in Chriſt: often tymes craving hard, but giving nothing wherwith to pay.</p>
               <p n="2">2 What they preach of Chriſt, and the matters of the Goſpell, not preaching the ſame in a Goſpell way whereof. See 1. Cor. 3. from the beginning at length.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Not commending as they ought, neither their own work, whether of meditation, or delyverie, nor their hearts to Chriſt, that He might give the increaſs: but going about the work, either altogether in their own ſtrength, or much that way.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Often tymes not ſpeaking, becauſe they believe, and many not ſeeking for communion with Chriſt, in their own perſonall eſtate; and to feele the power of the Word, vpon their own hearts: that they might ſpeak ſo.</p>
               <p>Theſe branches of contemning and abuſing of the Goſpell, are thought fitt for the better Information of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:180510:8"/>
all to bee held foorth at this tyme, as beeing moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, recommending with all to Miniſters, to apply themſelues, to make a more full and particular diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thereof; as is not doubted, but they will do, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their wiſdom and vnderſtanding, in the Goſpell; and the experience they have by obſervation of their own hearts, and of the wayes and conſciences of people.</p>
               <p>It is alſo found needfull and appoynted, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard it is not one or two, but many provocations of the people of God in this Land. which have drawn on the preſent ſad calamities and judgements: and that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, tho they have condeſcended vpon many ſinnes of the King and his Family of Iudicatories and of the people as vndoubted Cauſes thereof: yet are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that there is need of a further diſcovery. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vpon the foreſayd day of Humiliation, &amp; at other tymes both in publick and private earneſt ſupplications to be made to God, for light and unanimity to His ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in this matter; that the cauſes of Gods wrath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more fully and throughly ſeen; and the hearts of al humbled accordingly befor God, wee may bee yet ſett in a Way to fynd the Lords Mercy in due tyme.</p>
